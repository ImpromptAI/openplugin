Plugin Developers
=================

The tool selector service accepts the openplugin manifest file format, which is used to define the configuration and metadata of plugins that can be loaded and used by the service. This file format allows developers to specify various properties and settings for their plugins, such as the plugin name, version, dependencies, and supported platforms. The openplugin manifest file format provides a standardized way to describe plugins and enables seamless integration with the tool selector service.


The OpenPlugin manifest file has 3 main components:

1. OpenPlugin manifest file
2. OpenAPI specification file
3. OpenPlugin operations file
