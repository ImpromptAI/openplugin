Plugin Developers
=================


The OpenPlugin Manifest File has 3 main components:

1. OpenPlugin Manifest File
    This specifies properties for your plugins, such as the plugin name, version, dependencies, and supported platforms.
2. OpenAPI Specification File
    OpenPlugin leverages the OpenAPI specification for most of the details on your plugins.
3. OpenPlugin Operations File
    The OpenPlugin Operations File specifies additional details about calling API operations using natural language.
