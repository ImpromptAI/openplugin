OpenPlugin Manifest Repository
=================================


1. openplugin-manifests (for vendors)
------------------------------------------------

Repository Link: (https://github.com/ImpromptAI/openplugin-manifests)

This repository is dedicated to the storage of plugin assets specifically for our vendors. It comprises two distinct folders. The first folder contains official plugins, which are constructed and maintained by the vendors themselves. The second folder houses unofficial plugins, developed by independent developers who do not own the API, but are interested in creating plugins for certain vendors.

**How can I contribute?**

You are welcome to create a fork of this repository and subsequently generate a pull request featuring your plugin assets. Upon receipt of your pull request, our team will conduct a thorough review. Following approval, your plugin will be accessible to all users of Openplugin and Imprompt.

Please note: To publish your plugin in the official directory, it is essential to verify your ownership of the associated APIs.

#COMING_SOON: Steps to prove the ownership of the APIs.

**How can I use these plugins?**

There are two ways to use these plugins:

1. All plugins are accessible in the Imprompt marketplace. To use them, simply sign up at https://www.imprompt.ai and select the plugins you wish to use.

2. You can build and start the OpenPlugin server and use the OpenPlugin-SDK to access these plugins.

#COMING_SOON: redirect to do these steps.


2. openplugin-community (samples for developers)
------------------------------------------------
